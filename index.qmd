<!-- ### Monday night Stan installation session!  -->
<!-- To use Stan in R, the `rstan` R package is needed. To install it, follow the steps [in this vignette](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started). Make sure you can run the example in the **Verifying Installation** -->

<!-- If you have not yet managed to install Stan and `rstan`, Andrew and Guillaume will be available on **Monday evening**. From Tuesday onwards we won't have time to pause to fix installation issues! -->
