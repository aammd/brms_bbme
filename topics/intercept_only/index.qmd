## Variance partitioning with hierarchical models

Its very useful to have an idea of where the variation is in a dataset, as a guide to model building and future data collection. Before collecting information on independent variables that you think might explain variation -- first find out how much variation there is! 

Random intercepts give us a very handy way to investigate this: the so-called "intercept only" model. 
At this point in the course we now have all the tools needed to build it. There are two steps: first we build a model with no predictors at all, only a random intercept for every grouping variable in the data (e.g. species, sites, years, regions). Then we examine the relative magnitudes of the standard deviations to see which is relatively larger or smaller.

## Abundance of mites in different samples

We're going to build this by extending the observation level random effect model from the previous section. Remember that observation-level random effects are mostly useful for Poisson distributions! If you want to extend this model to other kinds of data, remember to remove that part of it.

### Mathematical model

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Abundance}_i &\sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i) \\
\log{\lambda_i} &\sim \mu + \beta_{\text{sample}[i]} + \beta_{\text{species[i]}} + \beta_i\\
\mu &\sim \text{Normal}(3, 1)\\
\beta_{\text{sample}} &\sim \text{Normal}(0,  \sigma_{\text{samp}})\\
\beta_{\text{species}} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{\text{species}})\\
\beta_i &\sim \text{Normal}(0,                \sigma_{\text{obs}}) \\
\sigma_{\text{samp}}    &\sim \text{Exponential}(3)\\
\sigma_{\text{species}} &\sim \text{Exponential}(3)\\
\sigma_{\text{obs}}     &\sim \text{Exponential}(3)
\end{align}
$$

### Load packages and prepare data

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
library(tidybayes)


data("mite", package = "vegan")
```

```{r}
spp_names <- colnames(mite)
spp_names <- setNames(1:ncol(mite), colnames(mite))


mite_long <- mite |> 
  mutate(site_id = seq_len(nrow(mite))) |> 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(-site_id,
                      names_to = "spp",
                      values_to = "abd") |> 
  dplyr::mutate(spp_id = spp_names[spp])

knitr::kable(head(mite_long))
```


## EXERCISE 

create a Poisson model of species abundance that offers *three* random intercepts: one for species, one for site, and another for observation level. 
TIP: the dataset has no factor for observation-level vairance, you may have to create one.
